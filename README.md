# 📰 NewsFetch-CLI

A Python-based command-line app that lets users search and read news articles on any topic using the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)

This is my 4th mini project in a self-driven weekly series to sharpen Python skills through real-world builds.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **User-defined topic search**
- 🗓️ **Fetches articles from the past 60 days**
- 📰 **Sorted by latest publish date**
- 🧠 **Top publishers appear first**

## ⚙️ How It Works
