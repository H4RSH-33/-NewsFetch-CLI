# 📰 NewsFetch-CLI

A Python-based command-line app that lets users search and read news articles on any topic using the [NewsAPI](https://www.notion.so/(%3Chttps://newsapi.org/%3E)).

This is my 4th mini project in a self-driven weekly series to sharpen Python skills through real-world builds.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **User-defined topic search**
- 🗓️ **Fetches articles from the past 60 days**
- 📰 **Sorted by latest publish date**
- 🧠 **Top publishers appear first**
- 💬 **Fully terminal-based experience**

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter a news topic (e.g., "AI", "SpaceX", "Climate")
- Automatically calculates a date range (last 2 months)
- Fetches relevant articles using the [NewsData.io](http://newsdata.io/) API
- Displays a numbered list of results (most recent first)

## 💻 Sample CLI Output

```bash
Enter the topic you're interested in: Artificial Intelligence

Fetching news articles for "Artificial Intelligence"...

1. AI is transforming global education – The Verge

3. Ethics in AI adoption – MIT Technology Review
...

Select an article number to view more details, or type 'exit' to quit.
